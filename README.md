Hello! Welcome to the Guessing Game!

You can play here: https://serenddi.github.io/guessing-game/

Rules: 
When you open the link, it creates a random number which you should guess. 
For guessing you have to write your idea in the field above the button "check! and press its.

After that you can see the text:
"Too low!" - it means you should try an other bigger number.
"Too high!" - it means you should try an other less number.

or "You won! :)"

Also one important thing - if you make a mistake, your score will decrease. When it will be 0 - you lost :( After the click on Reset & after reload it would be 20 again.
The string "Highscore" saves the highest score and you can see if your result is better than last one. It will change every time you play and won't delete after the click on Reset but it will delete after reload the page.

Enjoy the game! 

P.S. I will be grateful to your comments!
